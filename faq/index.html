                No, but it's highly recommended! The discord just makes it easier to communicate and talk with others, but we completely understand if you can't join it, this is why we made the website for ease of access.

                No, this server is community-run for CBHS students and friends and is not endorsed by CBHS. However, we'd still prefer you abide by school policy and/or keep it cool.

                The server is built for <strong>Java Edition 1.21.x</strong>. Close versions might still work,
                but if you have issues joining, switch to 1.21.x in the launcher.

                Yes, if you report someone, we will not share any details about who made the report. However, if you purposefully lie or boast about reporting someone, we may take action against you / you will likely not be anonymous anymore.
